    # Primarily used to switch between the mock-request framework used in testing
    # and the live framework used in real life (and live testing).
    # In theory, you could write your own HTTPService module if you need different functionality,
    # but since the switch to {https://github.com/arsduo/koala/wiki/HTTP-Services Faraday} almost all such goals can be accomplished with middleware.

    #   * server endpoints: you can override any or all the server endpoints
    #   (see HTTPService::DEFAULT_SERVERS) if you want to run requests through
    #   other servers.
